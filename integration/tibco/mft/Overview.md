# Overview

![mft_structure.png](/mft_structure.png)

TIBCO MFT is mainly composed of three elements: the Command Center, the Platform Server and the Internet Server.

## Command Center

The Command Center provides a graphical interface to manage all file transfers, both inside and outside the corporate infrastructure and therefore to all major platforms (SFTP Server, JMS, etc.).
It is in this section that users and groups are created, servers to interact with are added, transfers are configured and scheduled. The Command Center is installed in the corporate network and it is accessed from the browser.
