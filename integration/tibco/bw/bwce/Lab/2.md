# Comunicating between applications
The files to test the application are available at the following link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fgXdo7FDwWBpfAo2D3W2hpj0Rsa6PGDx

In this Lab we are going to create an application that calls the REST API created in Lab 1.

On Linux:
1. 	create a new directory  chiamaServizioRest
1. 	insert the appropriately modified Dockerfile and the application .ear file inside it
  
Build the calling service image inside the directory callServizioRest: **docker build -t bwce / callest service.**

  Then fisrt run the image that exposes the REST service: 
```
docker run -p 12000:12000 bwce/serviziorest
```
Afterwards run the calling image:
```
docker run bwce/chiamaserviziorest
```
