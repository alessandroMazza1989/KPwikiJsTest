# BusinessWorks 5
## Intro

TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks is an integration product suite for enterprise, web, and mobile applications.
The software allows you to create services and integrate applications using a visual, model-driven development environment, and then deploy them in the TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks runtime.

With TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks you can model integration processes of varying complexity using the following integration styles:
1.	**Batch-oriented** provides non-real-time integration for endpoints such as databases or files, and uses records for data abstraction.
1.	**Process-oriented** provides real-time integration for endpoints such as application APIs and adapters, and uses APIs, objects, and messages for data abstraction.
1.	**Service-oriented** provides real-time integration for endpoints such as web services and APIs, and uses services and messages for data abstraction.
1.	**Resource-oriented** provides real-time integration for endpoints such as mobile or web applications and APIs, and uses resources for data abstraction.

The **BW 5 stack** is made up of the following products (ems, hawk, rendezvous and adapter are also used with Tibco BW 6):
•	**EMS**
•	**TRA**
• **BW**
•	**Rendezvous**
•	**HAWK**
•	**Administrator**
•	**Adapter**


## TIBCO Runtime Agent (TRA) 

TIBCO Runtime Agent is a bundle of TIBCO software and third-party software that is needed to run many TIBCO applications such as TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks (TM) and TIBCO(R) Adapters. 
The TRA has two main functions: 
- Supplies an agent that is running in the background on each machine. 
- The agent is responsible for starting and stopping processes that run on a machine according to the deployment information. 
- The agent monitors the machine. That information is then visible via TIBCO Administrator. 
- Supplies the run-time environment, that is, all shared libraries including third-party libraries.

TRA also gives the possibility to work with tools such as domain utility and designer.

### TIBCO Domain Utility

TIBCO Runtime Agent includes TIBCO Domain Utility that is used to manage the components available in an administration domain.
TIBCO Domain Utility provides:
- **Machine Management**
  1. Add the machine on which TIBCO Domain Utility is running to an existing administration domain.
  1. Join a node that is part of a cluster to an administration domain.
- **Domain Configuration**
  1. Create a new administration domain for an existing TIBCO Administrator installation.
  1. Add a secondary server to an administration domain.
  1. Delete an administration domain. The administration server and the TIBCO Hawk agent for the administration domain must be shutdown before proceeding with this task.
  1. Enable and configure HTTPS for a selected administration domain on the machine on which TIBCO Domain Utility is running.
- **Server Settings**
  1. Change TIBCO Rendezvous parameters used by TIBCO Administrator and TIBCO Hawk for a selected administration domain on the machine on which TIBCO Domain Utility is running.
  1. Change the administration user name and password for a selected administration domain.
  1. Change LDAP configuration for a selected administration domain.
  1. Change database configuration for a selected administration domain.
- **Migration**
  1. Upgrade a release 5.x administration domain to release 5.9.
- **TIBCO EMS Plug-in**
  1. Add a TIBCO Enterprise Message Service server to a selected administration domain.
  1. Remove a TIBCO Enterprise Message Service server from a selected administration domain.
  1. Update a TIBCO Enterprise Message Service server in a selected administration domain.
  1. Add a Servlet Engine Plug-in
  1. Add or remove a servlet engine plug-in.

### DESIGNER
TIBCO Designer is a standards-based environment that allows you to graphically define your Integration logic and its parameters. All of the data is displayed in the same way, whatever their format. TIBCO Designer is built to be easy to use, and be the only tool to use from the design to the deployment part of your Integration projects. To allow you to easily maintain and reuse existing Integration logic, TIBCO Designer lets you manage these Integration logics and related artifacts in projects.

Once you open the project, TIBCO Designer displays:
- project on the top left corner
- palettes of activities/resources on the bottom left corner
- the process canvas or project explorer on the top right corner
- the properties canvas on the bottom left corner

## TIBCO RVRD (Rendezvous)
TIBCO RV (Rendezvous) is used for message communication among different enterprise applications for Enterprise Application’s Integration (EAI).
TIBCO RV works on the principle of subject based messaging in which messages are sent and received by different systems based on the subjects of interest. A daemon process known as RVD (Rendezvous Daemon) is used to receive the messages published on a particular RV subject. Those interested to subscribe to the message, express their interest to RVD by subscribing to that subject.
There are two modes of RV communication supported by TIBCO:
•	Reliable RV
•	Certified RV
How Reliable RV Works?
In case of Reliable RV communication in TIBCO, there is no certification mechanism used and messages not received by the subscribers are lost without maintaining any ledgers. Reliable RV doesn’t provide guaranteed message delivery and hence it is not a preferred choice for data critical applications.
Reliable RV protocol is implemented in RV Daemon (RVD). In case of Reliable RV, message retention is limited to duration of effective reliability duration.
How Certified RV Works?
TIBCO certified RV is a guaranteed message delivery mechanism in which messages published by a certified publisher are backed up in a ledger file till the time a receipt notification is received from the subscriber.  TIBCO supports both in memory ledgers as well as file based ledgers.
Certified RV in TIBCO is implemented at TIBRVCM. As notification is required for every message received by a subscriber, TIBCO Certified RV has additional overheads and hence it consumes more network bandwidth. Certified RV is not a recommended approach if your application is more time critical than data critical.
