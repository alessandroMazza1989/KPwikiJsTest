With TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks you can model integration processes of varying complexity using the following integration styles:
1.	**Batch-oriented** provides non-real-time integration for endpoints such as databases or files, and uses records for data abstraction.
1.	**Process-oriented** provides real-time integration for endpoints such as application APIs and adapters, and uses APIs, objects, and messages for data abstraction.
1.	**Service-oriented** provides real-time integration for endpoints such as web services and APIs, and uses services and messages for data abstraction.
1.	**Resource-oriented** provides real-time integration for endpoints such as mobile or web applications and APIs, and uses resources for data abstraction.

The **BW 5 stack** is made up of the following products (ems, hawk, rendezvous and adapter are also used with Tibco BW 6):
-	**EMS**
-	**TRA**
-  **BW**
-	**Rendezvous**
-	**HAWK**
-	**Administrator**
-	**Adapter**


## Tibco Runtime Agent (TRA) 

TIBCO Runtime Agent is a bundle of TIBCO software and third-party software that is needed to run many TIBCO applications such as TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks (TM) and TIBCO(R) Adapters. 
The TRA has two main functions: 
- Supplies an agent that is running in the background on each machine. 
- The agent is responsible for starting and stopping processes that run on a machine according to the deployment information. 
- The agent monitors the machine. That information is then visible via TIBCO Administrator. 
- Supplies the run-time environment, that is, all shared libraries including third-party libraries.

TRA also gives the possibility to work with tools such as domain utility and designer.

### TIBCO Domain Utility

TIBCO Runtime Agent includes TIBCO Domain Utility that is used to manage the components available in an administration domain.
TIBCO Domain Utility provides:
- **Machine Management**
  1. Add the machine on which TIBCO Domain Utility is running to an existing administration domain.
  1. Join a node that is part of a cluster to an administration domain.
- **Domain Configuration**
  1. Create a new administration domain for an existing TIBCO Administrator installation.
  1. Add a secondary server to an administration domain.
  1. Delete an administration domain. The administration server and the TIBCO Hawk agent for the administration domain must be shutdown before proceeding with this task.
  1. Enable and configure HTTPS for a selected administration domain on the machine on which TIBCO Domain Utility is running.
- **Server Settings**
  1. Change TIBCO Rendezvous parameters used by TIBCO Administrator and TIBCO Hawk for a selected administration domain on the machine on which TIBCO Domain Utility is running.
  1. Change the administration user name and password for a selected administration domain.
  1. Change LDAP configuration for a selected administration domain.
  1. Change database configuration for a selected administration domain.
- **Migration**
  1. Upgrade a release 5.x administration domain to release 5.9.
- **TIBCO EMS Plug-in**
  1. Add a TIBCO Enterprise Message Service server to a selected administration domain.
  1. Remove a TIBCO Enterprise Message Service server from a selected administration domain.
  1. Update a TIBCO Enterprise Message Service server in a selected administration domain.
  1. Add a Servlet Engine Plug-in
  1. Add or remove a servlet engine plug-in.

### DESIGNER
TIBCO Designer is a standards-based environment that allows you to graphically define your Integration logic and its parameters. All of the data is displayed in the same way, whatever their format. TIBCO Designer is built to be easy to use, and be the only tool to use from the design to the deployment part of your Integration projects. To allow you to easily maintain and reuse existing Integration logic, TIBCO Designer lets you manage these Integration logics and related artifacts in projects.

![des_ex.png](/bw5/des_ex.png)
Once you open the project, TIBCO Designer displays:
- project on the top left corner
- palettes of activities/resources on the bottom left corner
- the process canvas or project explorer on the top right corner
- the properties canvas on the bottom left corner

## Tibco RVRD (Rendezvous)
<center>

![rvrd.png](/bw5/rvrd.png)

</center>

**TIBCO RV (Rendezvous)** is used for message communication among different enterprise applications for Enterprise Application’s Integration (EAI).
TIBCO RV works on the principle of subject based messaging in which messages are sent and received by different systems based on the subjects of interest. A daemon process known as RVD (Rendezvous Daemon) is used to receive the messages published on a particular RV subject. Those interested to subscribe to the message, express their interest to RVD by subscribing to that subject.
There are two modes of RV communication supported by TIBCO:
- Reliable RV
- Certified RV

**How Reliable RV Works?**
In case of Reliable RV communication in TIBCO, there is no certification mechanism used and messages not received by the subscribers are lost without maintaining any ledgers. Reliable RV doesn’t provide guaranteed message delivery and hence it is not a preferred choice for data critical applications.
Reliable RV protocol is implemented in RV Daemon (RVD). In case of Reliable RV, message retention is limited to duration of effective reliability duration.

**How Certified RV Works?**
TIBCO certified RV is a guaranteed message delivery mechanism in which messages published by a certified publisher are backed up in a ledger file till the time a receipt notification is received from the subscriber.  TIBCO supports both in memory ledgers as well as file based ledgers.
Certified RV in TIBCO is implemented at TIBRVCM. As notification is required for every message received by a subscriber, TIBCO Certified RV has additional overheads and hence it consumes more network bandwidth. Certified RV is not a recommended approach if your application is more time critical than data critical.

## Tibco BusinessWorks

TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks components are designed to support development in phases and to let you seamlessly move from one phase to another.
- Using TIBCO Designer, you configure services, for example, a SOAP service.
- You can then access the SOAP service from activities inside the business process.
- After you’ve configured SOAP services and business processes, you can use TIBCO Designer to assign SOAP service to process engines.

You assign each service and process engine to a machine in the administration domain and deploy the project to the run-time environment.
You can then start and stop the service and process engines using the TIBCO Administrator GUI and manage and monitor them from there.
Following the phases in sequence results in a fast deployment that closely meets the specifications. Note that as a rule, you perform analysis, installation, and services configuration only once, then iterate through the other phases until you have arrived at the optimal configuration.

The main component installed with the BW package is the TIBCO BW engine. 
The TIBCO Business Works engine runs the business processes in test mode and at run-time. The engine starts process instances based on the process definitions stored in your project.

- The design phase involves creating and testing the project using TIBCO Designer.
-	During the deployment phase, you use TIBCO Designer to create an Enterprise Archive file (EAR file) that contains the required resources for running the project.
-	Then, you use TIBCO Administrator to deploy the project to the machine(s) where it will run.
-	In the run time phase, the TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks process engine executes the process instances of the deployed project and TIBCO Administrator can be used to monitor and manage the process engine.



## Tibco HawkAgent

Hawk consists of the following components:
- TIBCO Hawk Agent(s)
- TIBCO Hawk MicroAgent (HMA)
- TIBCO Hawk WebConsole
- TIBCO Hawk Admin Agent
- TIBCO Hawk Application Management Interface (AMI)
- TIBCO Hawk Console API
- TIBCO Hawk Event Service
- TIBCO Hawk Message Transport

**TIBCO Hawk** is an event-based monitoring system built around the concept of a distributed, autonomous smart agent that operates on each managed machine in the network.
The main objectives are:
- Deliver real-time visibility and control of distributed enterprise applications
- Utilize rules to assure system availability and performance

The software is designed specifically for monitoring distributed systems, so there is no centralized console or frequent polling across the network. With this structure, TIBCO Hawk is able to scale to multi-thousand node global networks without the use of hierarchical managers and has the flexibility to allow individual managed entities to be added or modified without the need to re-configure or re-start any other parts of the system.

</center>

**TIBCO Hawk Agent**
A TIBCO Hawk Agent is an autonomous process that should be installed on each computer to monitor systems and applications on that computer. The Hawk Agents operate autonomously and use sets of rules, called “Rulebases”. These rules help Hawk agents to configure system management, status reporting, and automation tasks. 

**TIBCO Hawk Microagent (HMA)**
The term **microagent** is a generic term used to refer to the Hawk managed set of methods exposed by an application. This is done using either instrumenting the application using Hawk AMI API, or via a Hawk plug-in, or via an adapter. See the following sections for a short description of each of them. The TIBCO Hawk Microagent or HMA is a standalone partner process to the Hawk Agent and provides various methods to the Hawk agent to instrument and monitor the host operating system and applications. The HMA is an application that uses the Hawk AMI application programming interface (API) for instrumentation. Like Hawk Agent, Hawk Microagent should be installed on each computer you wish to monitor.

**TIBCO Hawk WebConsole**
The TIBCO Hawk WebConsole application is a web application that provides a central view of all the distributed components interacting within Hawk System. It is a pictorial view of each of the infrastructure component that is being monitored with the help of Hawk components.
The web application enables you to:
- View statistical data about events, alerts and actions on all the infrastructure nodes that are being monitored, in the entire network as an easy-to-understand color-coded heatmap.
- Allows you to administer Rulebases, Rules and appropriate actions to be taken.
- Create your own sets of customized dashboards, without affecting other users. 

**TIBCO Hawk Admin Agent**
The TIBCO Enterprise Administrator (TEA) is a central administration console that provides multiple products to be configured and administered. Hawk provides an agent for TEA (the TIBCO Hawk Admin Agent) which, when registered with the TEA server, allows you to monitor and do the Hawk administration from within the TEA web user interface. Using the Admin agent, you can get a consolidated view of all the distributed infrastructure components interacting within the TIBCO Hawk system. Admin Agent provides pictorial details of each of the components and allows basic monitoring and management via alerts and rules.


## Tibco Administrator

TIBCO Administrator includes two main components, the administration server and TIBCO Administrator GUI. The administration server manages resources in an administration domain. The TIBCO Administration GUI provides a web browser interface, allowing you to configure users and applications, deploy applications, and monitor processes and machines in an administration domain.
The following modules are provided in the TIBCO Administrator GUI:
1. User Management
2. Resource Management
3. Application Management

**1.User Management**
This module allows you to create users and roles and assign them access rights to resources available in the administration domain.
An administration domain can be integrated with an LDAP directory server where users and groups are defined in an LDAP directory and imported into TIBCO Administrator:
- **Users**: You can create users and assign them into roles, which allow easier administration. You can   also set read, write or administer permissions so a user can directly access TIBCO Administrator     modules and consoles, and domain and application repositories.

- **Roles**: Access control is easier when roles are used. You can assign multiple users into roles and then assign permissions for the role, rather than each individual user.

- **Security**: Each resource in an administration domain can have users or roles assigned to it. The    security level setting determines who can access the resource and at what access level.

**2.Resource Management**
This module allows you to create and manage database connection of application domains, get information about installed TIBCO software on each domain machine, view the status of each domain machine, and configure monitoring rules and events that can trigger other actions such as sending email or running a command.
- **Application Domains**: If your TIBCO application supports this feature, you can create multiple application domains and assign applications to use them. An application domain allows you to specify that application data be written to a repository that is separate from the repository used by the administration domain. This is useful, for example, if an application needs to use a local database rather than that used by the administration domain.
- **Installed Software**: You can view TIBCO applications that are running on each machine in the domain and enable or disable applications. 
- **Machines**: Each administration domain contains one or more machines. You add a machine to an administration domain using the TIBCO Domain Utility.


**3.Application Management**
This module allows you to upload, deploy and undeploy an application’s Enterprise Archive (EAR) file and optionally change options and global variables that were set for the application when it was configured. You can also define monitoring rules for each application. You then deploy the application and start (or stop) it. The next diagram shows the TIBCO Administrator GUI with the application management module displaying its contained consoles. An application is selected and the configuration builder in the right panel displays the application, its service and service instance.
- Clicking an application name displays a panel where you can change global variable values set for the application when it was configured in TIBCO Designer. If TIBCO Rendezvous is set as the administration domain transport, you can specify the transport the client application will use when communicating with the administration server. You can also specify that the application’s repository be sent to the target machine, which allows the application to run independently of the administration server.
- Clicking the service name displays a panel where you can set monitoring options and other properties.
- Clicking the service instance name displays a panel where you can set logging options, whether to run as the instance as a service on Microsoft Windows, and shutdown options.



## Tibco Adapter

**TIBCO Adapters** are used as a bridge between other applications and TIBCO Integration environment for exchange of data between them.
There are four types of adapter services available which you can configure for your adapter application:
- **Publication Service**
- **Subscription Service**
- **Request-Response Service**
- **Request-Response Invocation Service**


---


**Tibco Adapter Publication Service**
Adapter publication service is used to publish any event in a vendor application to TIBCO Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) to make it available to interested TIBCO applications or processes. For example, you can configure adapter publication service which will be used to publish a message to ESB every time there is an update in a database table. TIBCO Adapter Publication Service works in asynchronous mode.

**Tibco Adapter Subscription Service**
Adapter Subscription service works opposite to what publication service does. Subscription service is used to subscribe to some event or action in TIBCO environment and makes it available to some external application. For example, you can write a subscription service which will intimate an external application (e.g. Oracle database), every time there is a new HTTP request received in a TIBCO process.
Just like adapter publication service, subscription service also works in asynchronous mode.

**Tibco Adapter Request-Response Service**
Adapter Request-Response service has same functionality as a subscription service with the only difference that it works in synchronous mode. Requests are initiated from TIBCO environment and some other application acts as the message target. In this synchronous communication model, target application sends back a response to the initiator (TIBCO environment).

**Tibco Adapter Request-Response Invocation Service**
Adapter Request-Response Invocation service has same functionality as Request-Response service with the only difference that target and initiators are reversed. In this type of service, vendor application serves as the initiator and TIBCO environment behaves as target. This type of communication is synchronous as TIBCO environment sends back response synchronously to vendor application for every request.
