# Zero downtime upgrade approach
In this guide we will see how to update BW from version 6.5 to version 6.6. HF-002 without creating disservices.

## Prerequisites

BW 6.5 installato su due macchine con bwagent in “High Availability” (DB + EMS)

## Installation

1. Back up the DB and the configuration files in the bwhome (bwagent.ini, bwagent_db.json), in the appspaces (config.ini, TRA file) and in the appnode (config.ini, TRA file, logback)

2. Turn off all applications and nodes on machine 1 (M1). Applications will continue to run smoothly on machine 2 (M2)

3. Turn off the M1 bwagent

4. If Hawk is present, deactivate the rules that monitor the M1. If possible, also turn off Hawk's agent and microagents

5. Install version 6.6 on the same tibco home. During installation, the old version will be detected and a message will ask whether to continue by overwriting it: continue

6. Install Hotfix 2

7. If present, uninstall and install the new Hawk BW6 Microagents

8. Install the DB and EMS drivers with the bwinstall command

## BWAgent configuration

1. Modify the “.profile” file by updating any paths with the references of version 6.6

2. Check the bwagent_db.json file and run the command
	-	bwadmin config -cf ../config/bwagent_db.json agent
 
3. In the BWAGENT table on the DB, update the AGENTVERSION column

4. Start the bwagent
