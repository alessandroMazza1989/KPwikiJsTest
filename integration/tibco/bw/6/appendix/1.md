# Product Setup

## Setup for CentOS 8

### Normal Setup

Obtain the setup files bundle from: BW 6.6.1 
Unzip it
There are 4 zipped files within, unzip only these:
TIB_BW_6.6.1_linux26gl23_x86_64
TIB_BW_6.6.1_HF-002
Follow installation instructions here: Installing in Console Mode 
Use unique installation path without spaces like: Home/userName/tibco_bw_version
After the setup install the Hotfix contained in the bundle: TIB_BW_6.6.1_HF-002
Copy the universal installer TIBCOUniversalInstaller-lnx-x86-64.bin contained in TIB_BW_6.6.1_linux26gl23_x86_64.
Run it again from that directory (in console mode), following the instructions.

### Troubleshooting (Not confirmed to work!)

“ANT Task: null has failed” errors during setup process?
Install libnsl library: sudo yum install libnsl
DB Error during setup process after solving Error 1? 
Go to BW6 installation path, then to .../tools/p2scripts
Open build.xml and go to the last few lines
In the javascript piece go to the if statement and edit it by adding a String casting
if(String(tmp). … the rest is the same.
Failed to load JavaHL Library during application start? 
Not tried yet: The error doesn’t compromise functionality as far as was observed.
