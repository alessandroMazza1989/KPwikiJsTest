Maven is a tool dedicated to build automation, mainly used for Java and Java-based projects. Here below the requirements and steps for the installation of Apache Maven and the BusinessWorks 6.6.1 Maven Plugin.


## Requirements
- **Java Development Kit 1.8.0_***
	Be sure that Java is correctly installed by executing from cmd the command *java -version*

- **Tibco BusinessWorks 6.6.1** installed
	The procedure can be also applied for Tibco BusinessWorks ContainerEdition.

## Step 1: Apache Maven

- Download Apache Maven from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
	Specifically, download the binary zip archive *apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.zip*
  
- Extract the contents of the archive in a working directory, for instance *C:\Program Files\Maven*![mavenbwplugin_2.png](/mavenbwplugin_2.png)


## Step 2: .m2 folders

- Add and extract this *.m2.zip* folder in the working directory (INSERIRE CARTELLA)

- Add this other *.m2* folder in the user directory ([.m2(user).zip](/.m2.zip))
	- Each user should have a copy of this folder in its own directory
	- Pay attention: this folder is different from the previous one

- Edit the **settings.xml** file inside the *.m2* user folder, setting the correct local repository path

- Open the cmd as administrator, go into the TIB_BW_Maven_Plugin_*version* extracted folder and execute the install.bat file
	- During the installation, provide the path of the Tibco-Home where BusinessWorks 6.6.1 is installed
  - Wait until the end of the installation
  

## Step 5: mavenize an application in Tibco Business Studio

- Right-click on your application and select *Generate POM for Application*
![mavenbwplugin_11.png](/mavenbwplugin_11.png)

- Do not modify the default options and click on *Finish*
![mavenbwplugin_12.png](/mavenbwplugin_12.png)

- You will see a **pom.xml** file in each project bundle, including in an additional one *project_name*.parent

	- Git submodules must be mavenized in a dedicated repository
  
  - If your application includes git submodules, DO NOT commit any change related to these submodules once you mavenize your application
