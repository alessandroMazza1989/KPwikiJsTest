# Exposing a REST WS on the Web from the VM

- Set VM Networking to “Bridged”. The VM will have its own address in the local network now.
- Disable VM’s firewall
	- Check if it’s running: sudo firewall-cmd --state
	- **Temporary solution (current session):** sudo systemctl stop firewalld 
	- **Permanent solution:** https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-stop-and-disable-firewalld-on-centos-7/ 
- Find VM’s local address:
	- Windows → in cmd: ipconfig -all
	- Linux: ifconfig
- Edit the HTTP configuration of the BW project changing Host to the **local address** of the VM as seen below.

- Enable port forwarding on the external router.
	- Make two rules, both pointing to the address of the VM:
		- one from port 7777 to 7777
		- the other from 80 to 8080.
	- (Cascading routers may make port forwarding malfunction.)
- How to reach:
	- Local address of the Swagger interface: http://VMADDR:7777/SERVICENAME/
	- Public address of the Swagger interface: http://PUBLICIP:7777/SERVICENAME/
	- Public REST service address: http://PUBLICIP:80/PATH_OR_QUERY
- Profit.
