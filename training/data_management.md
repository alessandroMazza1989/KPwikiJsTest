Main goal of this section is to provide the consultant with a basic knowledge of most commonly used data storage systems and the main query DSLs related to this cluster technologies. The course covers the fundamentals of ETL logics - data flow from a source to a target system through an optional enrichment process - and tools to implement such flows. The attendees are introduced to statistical metrics and basic aggregation types to apply to raw data and they will see various types of graphical visualization, both time-dependent and time-independent, learning how to best implement them through dedicated tools.
