# BusinessWorks 6

## General Concepts

APPLICATION >> MODULE >> PROCESS >> ACTIVITY

## Applications and Modules

- **APPLICATIONS:** Applications are packaged in deployable artifacts in the form of archive files.
- **MODULES:** An application is a collection of one or more modules and can be executed in the runtime.
	- **APPLICATION MODULE:** Each application contains only one Application Module.
		- Smallest resource.
		- Contains one or more processes, but also service descriptors (Swagger and WSDL files), schemas...
	- **SHARED MODULE:** export their functionality to Application Modules or to other shared modules.
		- Can be used by other modules that are part of the same application.
			- (At least officially, but shared modules are often used like libraries across many applications.)
		- Shared modules are usually made to contain direct subprocesses (see 2.2).
	- **BINARY SHARED MODULE:** A module compiled into a binary format for use by another application.
		- Acts like any shared module, but it can't be edited.
	- Modules cannot be run alone → must be packaged as part of an application.

## Processes

- They describe the flow of business information. It’s a .bwp file in BW.
- Any process that calls another process is a parent process, and the called process is called a subprocess.
- Stateful vs Stateless Process
	- **Stateful Process:** any process that relies on the BW engine to maintain its state across invocations.
		- It does NOT require an external persistence store.
	- **Stateless Process:**  Requires an external persistence store.
  
### Component Process 

- **Component Process (YELLOW):** It’s the process responsible for initiating the business logic (job) at runtime.
	- implements a process and provides information to the runtime on how to instantiate the process.
	- Generated for all and only for main processes initialized by the engine. Subprocesses do not need them.
	- **Component Services:** describe the binding information to receive an invocation from an external consumer.
		- When a component implements a process with a service, that service is exposed as a component service. The component service then must be configured using bindings such as SOAP and REST.
		- Loose Coupling: The service-centric architecture supports self-contained services. Each service is configured separately and can be deployed on a different machine. If one machine goes down, all other parts of the process can continue to run.
	- **Component References:** describe the binding information required to invoke an external service.
		- They can be public or private. Public references are visible from outside of the process.
		- They always reference one interface or port type.
		- They can be static or dynamic. Static ones can be used when the target service name is available at designtime, and dynamic ones when the target service name is not.
    
### Subprocesses

- There are 2 families of subprocesses:
	- **Direct Subprocess (GREEN):** Can only be accessed by processes within the same module. (Activity: Call Subprocess) A direct subprocess is non-WSDL-based.
		- **Regular**
		- **Dynamic Process Override:** the dynamic subprocess is chosen according to some runtime-dependent parameter(s).

![tibco_callprocess.png](/tibco_callprocess.png)

- ⚠️ **NOTE1:** The Process Name field must be populated with one among the possible subprocesses, so it can statically define the input/output structures.
- ⚠️ **NOTE2:** The possible subprocesses from which to choose must all share the same input/output structure.
- **Service Subprocess (BLUE):** They have a timeout and a wsdl. (Activity: Invoke)
	- **Local:** When the service is in the same module
	- **Dynamic Reference:** Using SetEPR you can access a service process from a different application, assuming it’s running within the same appnode.
- Inline vs Non-Inline Subprocess
	- **Inline Subprocess:** is part of the same job as the parent process, which means they share the same engine thread.
	- **Non-Inline Subprocess (or Spawned)**: execute on a separate, engine thread.
- **PROCESS SERVICES**
	- Expose the operations provided by the process and are implemented using a WSDL or a JSON file. 
	- When the process is implemented by a component, the process services are exposed as component services, which then need to be configured using bindings.
- **PROCESS REFERENCES**
	- Expose the operations consumed by the process and are implemented using a WSDL or a JSON file. 
	- Can be configured to invoke a process or an external service.
	- When the process is implemented by a component, the process references that are not configured to call a process or an external service through a binding are exposed as component references, which then need to be configured using bindings.
- **ACTIVATOR PROCESS**
	- Special process that can be used to perform preprocessing and postprocessing tasks.
	- Contains a process service with two operations: OnStartup and OnShutDown.
	- The activator process can only be configured for an Application Module.
	- There can be only one activator process for an Application Module.
- **PROCESS PACKAGES**
	- Process packages are groups of related processes.
	- Similar to Java packages in their visibility, which can either be **Public** or **Private**.
- **ACTIVITIES**
	- Definition
		- Activities are the individual units of work in a process.
		- Activities generally interact with an external system and perform a task.
		- Activities that perform similar tasks are grouped in an entity called a palette.
		- BW represents them with a movable icon.
	- Types
		- **Regular Activities:** perform a specific task. They can have I/O and Faults.
			- **Synchronous:** blocking.
			- **Asynchronous:** non-blocking.
		- **Process Starter Activities:** are configured to react to events, triggering the execution of a process.
		- **Signal-in Activities**: wait for an asynchronous event in a process. See Conversations.
- **PALETTES:** Group activities that perform similar tasks.
- **TRANSITIONS:** Represent the flow of execution from one activity or group to another. (They appear as arrows.)
	- **Transitions Without Conditions:** Control automatically flows from one activity or group to the next.
	- **Transitions With Conditions:** Conditions are evaluated before transitioning to the next activity or group.
	- **Error Transitions:** Specify the activities or groups to execute in case of an error.
- **SHARED RESOURCES:** contain common configuration data that can be referenced from multiple places.
	- **SHARED VARIABLES:** used to save the state, either at the Module level or for the duration of a job. 2 Types:
		- **Module Shared Variables:** visible to all processes created from the processes within a Module.
			- Visible and updateable by the process instances at runtime.
			- **Persistent Module Shared Variables:** preserves the state in case of an engine (or an AppNode) crash, by saving it in a DB.
		- **Job Shared Variables:** used to share the state at the job level for the duration of a job.
			- A copy is created for each new job and it is accessible to all processes of that job.
			- Non-inline subprocesses and direct subprocesses that have been spawned, obtain a copy of the job shared variable and not the current value of the variable from the caller process.
		- The key difference between them is that when jobs expand across *Module* boundaries, a job shared variable is visible outside the Module it was set in, while the *Module shared variable* is visible only inside the *Module* in which it was set.
		- **Synchronization (Concurrency)**
			- Use **Critical Section Groups** to avoid non-deterministic behavior.
		- **Accessible via the activities:**
			- Set Shared Variable
			- Get Shared Variable
- **GROUPS:** one or more activities that are assembled together and executed according to their type.

![tibco_group.png](/tibco_group.png)

- **Groups Without Conditions (Non-repetitive):**
	- **Scope:** normal
	- **Critical Section:** used to synchronize jobs (only one job acting on the group at a time) (concurrency).
		- Allows only one process instance to execute at any given time.
	- **Local Transaction:** It performs auto commit on a local transaction at the end of the group, making the use of transactional activities easier for users. (???)
- **Groups With Conditions (Repetitive) (Loops):**
	- **For Each:** loop for a number of iterations with a counter ranging from a start value to an end value.
	- **Iterate:** executes for the number of iterations specified
	- **Repeat:** has a simple index variable that can be used to count each iteration and has a conditional expression to determine when to stop.
	- **Repeat on Error:** involves a retry mechanism.
	- **While:** has a simple index variable that can be used to count each iteration and has a conditional expression to determine when to stop. The condition for the While loop is tested at the beginning of each iteration and the loop may never be executed if the condition is initially false.
- **PROPERTIES:** used to define a configuration.
	- **Can be only:** Boolean, Integer, DateTime, Long, Password, or String. (Values are static at runtime.)
	- Are hierarchically separate in the following categories:
		- Application Properties
			- Module Properties and Shared Module Properties: provide the default value for a Module.
				- Process Properties
	- Properties defined in the inner layer can reference a property defined at its parent layer.
	- Properties of the parent layer overrule the properties with the same name of the inner layer at runtime!

- **CONVERSATIONS**
	- Represent two or more related message exchanges in the same process which are correlated by the engine.
	- I.e., a conversation between a process and its clients, or between a process and its back-end service.
	- Used for stateful processes, where the engine manages the state and correlates messages with the process.
	- A conversation is defined within the scope of a process.
	- The activity that initiates a conversation generates a conversation ID. Other activities can join in.
	- The engine uses the conversation ID to correlate messages with the right process.
- **EVENT HANDLERS:** used to overcome issues with interruptive and blocking activities (that need to be waited on).
	- Event handlers allow asynchronous event processing, and execute parallel to the process’ business logic.
	- 2 Levels:
		- **Process level:** allows you to cancel the job.
		- **Scope level:** allows you to cancel the scope.
	- Tasks within a scope or process can be terminated, prior to executing the tasks within the event handler, using the Cancel Scope Execution option.

![tibco_event_handler.png](/tibco_event_handler.png)

- **FAULT HANDLERS:** Catch faults or exceptions and create fault-handling procedures.
	- 2 Types:
		- **Catch Specific Fault**
		- **Catch All Faults**
	- 2 Levels:
		- **Process level:** allows you to catch fault in a process.
		- **Scope level:** allows you to catch fault within a scope.
	- Once a fault handler is executed, the associated scope is not completed.
	- If there’s a fault and no fault handlers are found in the enclosing scopes, then the job terminates with a fault.
	- An **Exit** activity inside the fault handler returns the control out of the scope and the process.
  
![tibco_event_handler_example.png](/tibco_event_handler_example.png)

- **SERVICES**
	- Services and references are defined at the process level while the bindings at the component level.
	- Supported Service Classes: REST, SOAP (over HTTP or JMS)
	- Characteristics
		- **Interfaces:** describe the operations available within a service. An interface is analogous to a porttype in a WSDL file. Each interface can contain multiple operations.
		- **Operations:** define an action performed by the service and the way the message is encoded.
			- There are two types of message exchange operations: one-way and request-response.
		- **Transport:** used for communication such as HTTP or JMS.
		- **Schema:** used for message exchanges such as XSD.
- **POLICIES:** set of constraints that you can define and apply to manage and enforce cross-functional requirements within your application, such as security, monitoring, and compliance.
	- Examples of policies provided by BW:
		- **Basic Authentication:** Validates the user name and password credentials stored in the HTTP header of REST, SOAP, or pure HTTP request messages.
		- **Basic Credential Mapping:** Automatically attaches appropriate credentials to request messages before they reach services.
		- **Web Services Security Provider (WSS Provider):** Acts on the server side to ensure the security of a message by enforcing confidentiality, integrity, and time stamping.
		- **Web Services Security Consumer (WSS Consumer):** Acts on the reference side to ensure the security of a message by enforcing confidentiality, integrity, and time stamping.
- **POLICY DEFINITION CONCEPTS**
	- **Policy:** see paragraph above.
	- **Policy Types:** depending on the services they can be HTTP Policy Types or SOAP Policy Types.
	- **Activities:** You can add policies to activities to influence or alter actions in a process flow.
	- **Bindings:** A binding is used to establish a connection between SOA Services and their consumers. 2 Types:
		- **Service Binding:** used to create and expose a service to the world. The service can contain one or more operations.
		- **Reference Binding:** used to create a client that can connect and communicate to an external service.
	- **Shared Resources:** Policies reference shared resources.
  
## Runtime and Administration Concepts

### Basic Concepts

![tibco_architecture.png](/tibco_architecture.png)

- **RUNTIME:** refers to the AppNode and the BW engine that host and execute BW applications.
- **APPLICATION ARCHIVES:** is the deployment unit for an application that is generated in BW. (EAR)

### Runtime Entities

- **PROCESS INSTANCE:** It’s the scope of execution of the activities of a process.
	- **Unique ID:** Each process has a unique ID "ProcessInstanceId".
- **JOB**: It’s the execution of a **Component Process**.
	- **Unique ID:** Each job has a unique id referred to as JobId.
	- **The engine always executes a job in one engine thread!**
		- Multithreading depends on the use of asynchronous **Activities**.
- **APPNODE:** (also bwappnode) is an OS process (JVM) that hosts and executes BW applications (plural).
	- 2 LAYERS:
		- **The OSGI Framework:** performs application life cycle operations, ensures that dependencies are satisfied, and interacts with the Administrator (bwadmin).
		- **The BW Engine:** responsible for executing the application (**multithreaded**).
	- They are contained within AppSpaces, and an AppNode can belong to only one AppSpace.
	- **The AppNodes read their configuration and data only from the local file system, making the file system the source of truth.**
	- AppNodes can be added dynamically after deployment for load-balancing.
- **APPSPACE:** is a collection of one or more AppNodes, which are runtime entities that host BW applications.
	- They are contained within a Domain.
	- CoApplication names and AppNodes must be unique within an AppSpace.
	- They can span multiple physical machines across networks.
	- One or more than one application can be deployed to an AppSpace.
	- An AppSpace is **extensible**, which allows AppNodes to be added dynamically to scale the load on an application, thereby providing load-balancing and fault-tolerance for applications.
- **DOMAINS:** logical group that provides an isolated environment for Applications and their resources to reside.
	- Runtime entities such as AppSpaces and AppNodes are contained within a domain.
	- (It can be used to deploy the applications developed by a single team working on the architecture alongside other teams, each with a different domain.)
	- A domain manifests as a folder in the file system located in <TIBCO_HOME>\bw\domains.
		- This folder contains the subfolders appspaces and appnodes.
- **bwagent:** is a daemon process that runs on each BW installation.
	- When multiple installations across machines are configured as a network, the bwagents interact using a datastore. They also synchronize the data from the datastore with the local file system.
	- There are multiple ways to access the bwagent: 
		- bwadmin
		- the Admin UI
		- the REST API

## Notes on Using BW (DESIGN Time)

### Random Notes To Avoid Problems

- ⚠️**Never Copy/Paste activities!!!** It can lead to hard-to-find errors.
- ⚠️**Never share the same HTTPConnectionResource among different server applications!** (With client applications it should be ok.) 
	- Make an HTTPConnectionResource for each application and have it placed within the application, just make sure to use different ports for each. (Use ports from 10000 and above)

### Regarding the Execution Flow of Process Branches and Synchronicity

- Branching arrows in a process does not imply creating new threads or forks! Everything is still sequential, but the order in which activities are executed is decided by BW.
	- In practice, parallel branches execute activities alternating one activity for each branch at a time.

### Regarding the Synchronicity of Sleep and JavaInvoke

![tibco_sync.png](/tibco_sync.png)

- Sleep Activity is ASYNCHRONOUS. In other words it counts its timer in a different thread, but it interrupts the branch.
- JavaInvoke Activity is SYNCHRONOUS, thus it’s interrupting the whole process. 
	- (If sleep has already started in the image above, then it keeps counting in the background while JavaInvoke executes The resulting delay where the branches join will be that of the sleep activity alone, if it’s time is longer.)

### On Using Parameters in REST Applications

- Use path parameters whenever possible, then query parameters if unavoidable, then header parameters if absolutely necessary or in special cases.
	- Usage of header parameters will make REST service inaccessible via a simple URL on the browser. An application like postman will be necessary to set header parameters.

### On Handling XSD Schemas

- Put schemas in shared modules whenever possible.
- Always have one schema just for all complex types.
- Have an elements schema for each major operation (each GET, each POST, etc…)

### Adding Java Code (Java Invoke Palette)

- When creating a new application module, select the Use Java configuration check box. For an existing application module, right-click the project name in the Project Explorer view and select Configure > Convert to Java project.
	- This will create an src path in the project module where to place java classes.
	- No need to create a main class, as it’s already part of the application.
- Add a **Java Invoke** activity from the palette.
- **JavaInvoke** is **SYNCHRONOUS** (i.e., it's interrupting).

### Using BW JDBC for PostgreSQL on Windows

- **IMPORTANT:** BW 6.6’s included JDBC runtime drivers are not compatible with postgres 13!!! 
	- Use a prior version.
- Using native driver tibcosoftwareinc.jdbc.postgresql.postgreSQLDriver crashes BW on Windows
	- Use alternative driver from the dropdown list:
  
![tibco_jdbc.png](/tibco_jdbc.png)

### Using EMS and JMS on BW6.6

- Have TIBCO EMS Installed.
	- Run once (tibemsd) to configure at least an admin (tibemsadmin).
- We need to install the EMS drivers in BW.
	- Go to TIBCO_HOME\bw\6.6\bin
	- Run bwinstall
	- Find the EMS Driver name in the list of available commands and rerun:
		- bwinstall[.exe/sh] [selected EMS Driver]
- Run Gems (Or alternatively do this via the tibemsadmin tool.)
	- Go to Queues and add a queue with name only “>”.
- **To configure a direct connection to the EMS Server:**
	- Create a JMSConnection Resource and configure it like so:

![tibco_jms.png](/tibco_jms.png)

- To configure a connection via JNDI resource (in case it doesn’t work by default:
	- Run Gems (Or alternatively do this via the tibemsadmin tool.)
		- Connect to the EMS and go to the Factories tab and Create 2 factories for Queues and Topics, like so:

![tibco_jms_queueconnfactory.png](/tibco_jms_queueconnfactory.png)
![tibco_jms_topicconnfactory.png](/tibco_jms_topicconnfactory.png)
	
- Return to BW:
	- Create a JNDIConfiguration Resource and use its default configuration.
	- Create a JMSConnection Resource and configure it like so (default config):

![tibco_jms_jndi.png](/tibco_jms_jndi.png)

- Test Connection

# APPENDIX 1 - Setup

## Setup for CentOS 8

### Normal Setup

Obtain the setup files bundle from: BW 6.6.1 
Unzip it
There are 4 zipped files within, unzip only these:
TIB_BW_6.6.1_linux26gl23_x86_64
TIB_BW_6.6.1_HF-002
Follow installation instructions here: Installing in Console Mode 
Use unique installation path without spaces like: Home/userName/tibco_bw_version
After the setup install the Hotfix contained in the bundle: TIB_BW_6.6.1_HF-002
Copy the universal installer TIBCOUniversalInstaller-lnx-x86-64.bin contained in TIB_BW_6.6.1_linux26gl23_x86_64.
Run it again from that directory (in console mode), following the instructions.

### Troubleshooting (Not confirmed to work!)

“ANT Task: null has failed” errors during setup process?
Install libnsl library: sudo yum install libnsl
DB Error during setup process after solving Error 1? 
Go to BW6 installation path, then to .../tools/p2scripts
Open build.xml and go to the last few lines
In the javascript piece go to the if statement and edit it by adding a String casting
if(String(tmp). … the rest is the same.
Failed to load JavaHL Library during application start? 
Not tried yet: The error doesn’t compromise functionality as far as was observed.
Check here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11769989/failed-to-load-javahl-library/28127000 

## Setup for Windows

# APPENDIX 2 - Installing GitLab Plugin for BW6.6.1 (egit)

## Installation

- **NOTE:** The plugin is already pre-installed in version 6.7 of BW
- The plugin in question is egit, and it’s made for the Eclipse IDE, which is what BW uses.

![tibco_egit1.png](/tibco_egit1.png)

![tibco_egit2.png](/tibco_egit2.png)

## Plugin Setup: Setting the SSH Key

- The SSH protocol provides authentication to the GitLab remote server without need of credentials.
- There are two possible approaches to pair the IDE with GitLab: Generating a key through Eclipse and exporting it to Gitlab, or vice versa. Here we’ll see the first method.

- Open Eclipse and go to Window > Preferences > SSH2 > Key Management

![tibco_egit_ssh.png](/tibco_egit_ssh.png)

- Click Generate RSA Key

![tibco_egit_ssh2.png](/tibco_egit_ssh2.png)

- Choose a Passphrase.
- Copy the generated key for later use.
- Save the Private Key
	- **NOTE:** if you choose a key name make sure to add it in the general tab.
- **Import SSH key from GitLab.**
	- Log into GitLab.
	- Go to user settings.
	- Select the SSH Keys tab on the column on the left side.
	- Paste the previously generated key in the box
	- Choose a name for the key then click the Add Key button.

# APPENDIX 3 - Exposing a REST WS on the Web from the VM

- Set VM Networking to “Bridged”. The VM will have its own address in the local network now.
- Disable VM’s firewall
	- Check if it’s running: sudo firewall-cmd --state
	- **Temporary solution (current session):** sudo systemctl stop firewalld 
	- **Permanent solution:** https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-stop-and-disable-firewalld-on-centos-7/ 
- Find VM’s local address:
	- Windows → in cmd: ipconfig -all
	- Linux: ifconfig
- Edit the HTTP configuration of the BW project changing Host to the **local address** of the VM as seen below.

- Enable port forwarding on the external router.
	- Make two rules, both pointing to the address of the VM:
		- one from port 7777 to 7777
		- the other from 80 to 8080.
	- (Cascading routers may make port forwarding malfunction.)
- How to reach:
	- Local address of the Swagger interface: http://VMADDR:7777/SERVICENAME/
	- Public address of the Swagger interface: http://PUBLICIP:7777/SERVICENAME/
	- Public REST service address: http://PUBLICIP:80/PATH_OR_QUERY
- Profit.

# APPENDIX 4 - Installing Apache Maven and Maven Plugin for BW6.6.1

Maven is a tool dedicated to build automation, mainly used for Java and Java-based projects. Here below the requirements and steps for the installation of Apache Maven and the BusinessWorks 6.6.1 Maven Plugin.


## Requirements
- **Java Development Kit 1.8.0_***
	Be sure that Java is correctly installed by executing from cmd the command *java -version*
  ![mavenbwplugin_1.png](/mavenbwplugin_1.png)

- **Tibco BusinessWorks 6.6.1** installed
	The procedure can be also applied for Tibco BusinessWorks ContainerEdition.

## Step 1: Apache Maven

- Download Apache Maven from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
	Specifically, download the binary zip archive *apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.zip*
  
- Extract the contents of the archive in a working directory, for instance *C:\Program Files\Maven*![mavenbwplugin_2.png](/mavenbwplugin_2.png)


## Step 2: .m2 folders

- Add and extract this *.m2.zip* folder in the working directory (INSERIRE CARTELLA)
![mavenbwplugin_3.png](/mavenbwplugin_3.png)

- Add this other *.m2* folder in the user directory ([.m2(user).zip](/.m2.zip))
	- Each user should have a copy of this folder in its own directory
	- Pay attention: this folder is different from the previous one
![mavenbwplugin_3a.png](/mavenbwplugin_3a.png)
  
- Edit the **settings.xml** file inside the *.m2* user folder, setting the correct local repository path
![mavenbwplugin_4.png](/mavenbwplugin_4.png)


## Step 3: environment variables

- Configure the environment variable **M2_HOME**
	- Open the System Properties and go to Environment Variables
![mavenbwplugin_5.png](/mavenbwplugin_5.png)
	
  - Add a new system variable with M2_HOME as the name and the Maven working directory as the value
![mavenbwplugin_6.png](/mavenbwplugin_6.png)

- Edit the **PATH** environment variable
	- Select the already existing PATH variable and click on Edit
![mavenbwplugin_7.png](/mavenbwplugin_7.png)

	- Add the path to the Maven bin folder
![mavenbwplugin_8.png](/mavenbwplugin_8.png)


## Step 4: Plugin for BW6.6.1

- Be sure that you have Apache Maven correctly installed by executing on cmd the command *mvn --version*
![mavenbwplugin_9.png](/mavenbwplugin_9.png)

- Download the Tibco BusinessWorks Maven Plugin  from https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/bw6-plugin-maven/releases and extract it
![mavenbwplugin_10.png](/mavenbwplugin_10.png)

- Open the cmd as administrator, go into the TIB_BW_Maven_Plugin_*version* extracted folder and execute the install.bat file
	- During the installation, provide the path of the Tibco-Home where BusinessWorks 6.6.1 is installed
  - Wait until the end of the installation
  

## Step 5: mavenize an application in Tibco Business Studio

- Right-click on your application and select *Generate POM for Application*
![mavenbwplugin_11.png](/mavenbwplugin_11.png)

- Do not modify the default options and click on *Finish*
![mavenbwplugin_12.png](/mavenbwplugin_12.png)

- You will see a **pom.xml** file in each project bundle, including in an additional one *project_name*.parent
![mavenbwplugin_13.png](/mavenbwplugin_13.png)

	- Git submodules must be mavenized in a dedicated repository
  
  - If your application includes git submodules, DO NOT commit any change related to these submodules once you mavenize your application
